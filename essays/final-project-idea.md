## Project: Engage

## Overview
### The problem: 
Socializing is an essential part of a student's success in school. It can help decrease stress and anxiety. 
It could also help students form new relationships with like-minded students. What better way to socialize than bonding over your favorite activity. 
Unfortunately, it isn't easy to find other students with similar likeness. Some students are a bit reserved, which is harder for them to ask or invite.

### The solution: 
Engage could help organize activities for U.H. students. Students can log in schedule or find activities in pre-registered
lists/directories. There is also an option to create new activities if it is not included in the lists/directories. The activities are supposed to be 
casual, so that it is easy to put out requests and join others.

If an activity, for instance quidditch, is not in the list of possible activities to organize or join, it is possible to send in suggestions.
These suggestions can be either declined or accepted by an admin, and if accepted it will be added as an activity option.   

## Mockup page ideas
- Login page
- Choose activity page 
- Create activity page (with ability to share the activity with a link to the activity)
- Specific activity page with list/calendar
- Filters should be implemented (areas, time slots, gender (some people prefer to play sports with the same gender))
- Specific activity with an overview of the people who have joined
- Admin page

## Use case ideas
- New user goes to landing page, logs in, goes to home page, and sets up a profile.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to activities page, and signs up for activities.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, and views the activities they have scheduled.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, creates activity, and adds it to activities page.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, visits other peopleâ€™s profiles, and invites them to specific activity.
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, goes to activity page, and manages activities.

## Beyond the basics
- Two types of accounts, user and admin.
- Users: 
  - Rate and review events.
  - Create groups for ease of scheduling. 
  - Reuse previous event formats.
  - Able to show interest or commit to going to the events. 
  - Able to have a profile. Profile also holds history of events attended.
- Admin: 
  - Reviews event request sent in by users for approval.
