## Introduction
As a college student just starting out my journey in the field of computer science, I've learned my fair share of Java and have dipped my toes into languages like JavaScript and Python. However, I have little experience with making code that can be used outside of school assignments. I want this to change, and I'm confident it will with some of the more upper-level classes I'm taking. Specifically, this fall semester I am taking a class focused on software engineering, a field that utilizes programming to create meaningful software used in real-world settings. Therefore, I'm certain that learning about this field will guide me on the path to writing more meaningful code that serves a greater purpose than getting a good grade. Not to mention, software engineering will help me explore interests I've had ever since I decided I wanted to pursue computer science.

## My Interests

One of these interests is learning how to design a webpage using languages like HTML. I vaguely recall taking a small HTML course on my own time in middle school, but I don't think I ever finished it. However, I am adamant in trying harder this time around and learning how to build webpages and websites. Not to mention, it would be cool to understand the script I see when I view page sources to try and find publishing dates for citations. Alongside webpage design, I am also highly interested in creating applications for computers and mobile devices. I've always had a deep fascination for how programmers created games, such as the explosively popular Flappy Bird, along with other apps. Software engineering encompasses much more than web and app creation, so I'm also looking forward to expanding my interests in the near future.

## Reaching a Successful Future
To be able to pursue my interests, I have many goals to get there. First of all, I want to become familiar with using multiple programming languages and technologies together to create large software projects. Along with this, I want to gain experience working with a team to make such projects. In addition, I want to develop my problem-solving skills, so I'll be prepared for whatever problems I'll face while working in a team or for a computer science job. The future presents an endless number of possibilities, so I'm hopeful software engineering will help expand my horizons and forge a path that will lead me to success.
