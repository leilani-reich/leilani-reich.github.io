## Project Details
Chick Dance Revolution is my mentor project for [ICSpark](https://icspark.github.io/people.html), a club which provides coding mentorship (specifically web development) to 6th-12th graders.
This game revolves around a baby chicken, a chick, dancing in time to different music notes, which are represented by arrow keys. I created the game to showcase HTML/CSS/JS skills and give students a fun project to work on and enhance their understanding of web development.

## My Process

In the beginning, I had several ideas on what I wanted my project to be. One thing was for certain though: I wanted to make a game. Eventually, I decided on the topic of dance as it seemed pretty unique and interesting to incorporate.
Thus, I started out on Chick Dance Revolution. As to why I chose a chick as the main character, what can I say, I like chickens. Anyway, to create the game,

## What I learned

From making this inverse Tic-Tac-Toe Game, I learned many things. First off, I learned how to use the graphics interface, paint component method, graphic objects, and mouse events in Java. In addition, I've learned that I need to be really careful with my code and test it effectively, especially in large programs. Just one bug can result in a huge waste of time, which I found out the hard way. Overall, this project taught me that programming requires a lot of time, planning, effort, thought, and problem-solving skills.

Here's my Program in Action!
