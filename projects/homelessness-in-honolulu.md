## Project Details
 In this project, I created a 7-page-long research paper titled "The Homeless in Hawai'i: Shackled by Society". The paper focuses on the struggles of the homeless in Honolulu and their stories as a community. The project required an immense amount of research over the course of a month on Honolulu's homeless and the issues they've faced in relation to the police, government, hunger, and discrimination. Once I collected what I thought to be a sufficient amount of sources and picked out the best ones, I crafted a paper elaborating on the subject, following guidelines given by my English instructor.

## My Process
I was the only contributor to this project, and I had roles as both a writer and researcher. I started out my English project by doing the following each week: gathering research about the homeless in Hawaii, summarizing my findings, writing a reflection, and creating/adding to my own to-do list of tasks I needed to complete. After I developed a solid basis for what I was going to write, I spent a week actually putting together the paper. I introduced the focus of my paper, Honolulu's homeless; gave the history behind homelessness in Hawai'i; analyzed the struggles of Honolulu's homeless; and emphasized the injustices these individuals have faced. Of course, I also added in in-text citations when appropriate, as well as a works cited page at the end of my essay.


## What I Learned
Crafting this research paper helped me become more comfortable with my writing abilities and citation skills. In particular, I learned how structure a research essay and write an analysis. Also, I improved my knowledge on the citation style MLA 8. On a different note, I gained insight into the true stories of Honolulu's homeless. In the end, completing this project allowed me to improve as a writer, expand my knowledge, gain an open mind, and write at the college level.
