## Project Details

The purpose of the Kupuna Project was to get students to present a cultural food they were familiar with in a creative manner and in a way that they could share it with other classmates. There were two main tasks given: making a Google site and creating a video on the food with the help of someone knowledgeable on the dish - a kupuna - who could tell their experiences/stories. For my project, I chose the Filipino sweet biko, a sweet rice cake made with sticky rice, coconut milk, and brown sugar. On my Google site, I explained my personal connection to biko, presented nutritional information on the dish, and elaborated on its health benefits. In my video, I interviewed my mom because she grew up eating biko in the Philippines and her father was a rice farmer, so she had a lot of experience with the dish. Afterward, I published my site and video and watched my classmates' videos on their cultural foods.

## My Process

For this project, I was the main contributor. I created the google site by myself and made the video on biko with the help of my mom. When I was beginning the Kupuna Project, I first had to decide what food I wanted to talk about, which stumped me for a while. Eventually, however, I decided on biko because it was a treat my mother made for me when I was younger, and it was always one of my favorites. After I made this decision, I quickly began working on the biko video. Behind the scenes, I asked my mom on what she knew about biko and her personal history with the dish back in her hometown. We then used her stories and experiences to compose a script for the video and record a dialogue. Afterward, I used the video editor Moovly to create the actual video. First, I input the pre-recorded voice lines. Next, I started adding in visual components, like royalty free videos, simple animations, and transitions to go along with what was being said. Soon, I was done editing and syncing everything together and moved on to create the google site, incorporating the topics I discussed in the project details section. Making the Google site took a lot of time for me because it involved a good amount of research, but I was proud of how it turned out in the end.

## What I Learned

From my experience with the Kupuna Project, I gained important experience I think will help me in the future. First off, I learned how to create and edit videos. Prior to the Kupuna Project, I had done little video editing, so I'm glad I gained experience with Moovly. Next, I discovered how to cite tables and figures -  including a picture and nutrition label - in MLA, which I'd never done previously. I also gained skills in using Google sites and designing a good website on a topic. Not to mention, I learned more about biko itself and its history in the Philippines. All in all, I'd say that the kupuna project was a worthwhile endeavor.
